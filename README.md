# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aleah Johnson

I'm a 21-year-old Mechanical Computer Aided Design (CAD) graduate from the Tennessee College of Applied Technology – Jackson (Class of August 2025), based in Memphis, TN.

With a strong foundation in mechanical drafting and hands-on design, I specialize in creating precise 2D and 3D models using tools like **AutoCAD**, **SolidWorks (CSWA)**, **Revit**, and **Inventor**. My work focuses on blueprint development, design for manufacturability (DFM), and assembly modeling — all built on engineering standards and real-world application through internship and project experience.
